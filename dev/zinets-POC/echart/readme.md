## Poem: The Learning Character
```
In the garden of knowledge, a thousand seeds await, 
Each character a universe, each concept a fate. 
Bound by invisible threads of meaning and light, 
A network of wisdom appears gradually in sight.

Like the brush strokes of 日 shining in the sky, 
We build bridges between worlds that multiply. 
What once seemed foreign now feels like home, 
As patterns emerge in our semantic room.

The ancient and modern dance in one space, 
Technology and tradition embrace with grace. 
We charted each star in this dark night, 
the vast heaven turns gently bright.

A journey of ten thousand miles begins with one step,
This truth we hold close as our covenant is kept. 
For in learning the character of a single word, 
The voice of all human knowledge can be heard.

May this path we've forged lead beyond the known, 
Into realms where wisdom has always grown. 
Today we planted a small humble tree, 
Tomorrow, a forest of deep knowledge will set us free.
