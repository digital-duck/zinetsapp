# Roadmaps


## Development Roadmap Suggestions by Claude - 2025-05-14

Since you're still in the prototype phase, here are some practical next steps that might help prioritize your development efforts:

1. **User Testing**: Even with a limited prototype, getting feedback from a small group of Chinese language learners or educators could provide valuable insights about which features they find most useful.

2. **Core Functionality Refinement**:
   - Optimize the parsing algorithm for larger character networks
   - Improve the visualization rendering for complex hierarchies
   - Enhance the error recovery for LLM API failures

3. **Progressive Enhancement**:
   - Start with a solid single-language version before expanding all multilingual features
   - Focus on the most common use cases first (e.g., educational contexts)
   - Implement basic features completely before adding advanced ones

4. **API Reliability**:
   - Consider implementing a more robust fallback system for when LLM APIs are unavailable
   - Add local, rule-based character information as a backup when API data isn't available
   - Cache more aggressively to reduce dependency on external services

5. **Documentation and Examples**:
   - Create sample character networks for different domains (common characters, radicals, themed groups)
   - Document the markdown format thoroughly for users who want to create their own networks
   - Add tutorials for different user types (students, teachers, linguists)

## Technical Challenges to Consider

As you develop further, a few technical areas might require special attention:

1. **Character Rendering**: Some rare or complex characters might need special handling to display correctly across different platforms.

2. **Cache Consistency**: As you gather data from different LLM sources, maintaining consistent quality in your cache will become important.

3. **Performance Optimization**: For very large character networks, you might need to implement lazy loading or visualization optimization techniques.

4. **Maintainability**: As the codebase grows, considering a more modular architecture might help manage complexity.

Your multi-lingual support is an excellent feature that sets your tool apart from many others. It shows you're thinking about accessibility and international usage early in the development process, which is commendable. This foundation will serve you well as you continue to build out the tool.
