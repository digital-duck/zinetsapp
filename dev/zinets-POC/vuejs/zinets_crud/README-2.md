## Chinese Character Manager - Project Summary

I've created a comprehensive Chinese character management application that allows you to perform CRUD operations on Chinese character data. The application has the following components:

### 1. Vue.js Frontend

The frontend is built with Vue.js 3 and uses Element Plus for UI components. Key features include:

- **Search Panel**: Filter characters based on various criteria (character, meaning, provider, active status)
- **Character List**: Display characters in a paginated table
- **Character Detail Form**: View and edit character details
- **Create/Update/Delete Operations**: Full CRUD functionality

The interface is divided into two main panels:
- **Upper panel**: Shows a list of characters in a table with pagination
- **Lower panel**: Displays a form for viewing and editing character details

### 2. FastAPI Backend

The backend API handles all database operations and provides endpoints for:

- Retrieving characters with filters and pagination
- Getting a specific character by its primary key
- Creating new characters
- Updating existing characters
- Soft-deleting characters (marking as inactive)

### 3. SQLite Database

The application uses SQLite for data storage with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS character_cache (
    character TEXT,
    pinyin TEXT,
    meaning TEXT,
    composition TEXT,
    phrases TEXT,
    llm_provider TEXT,
    llm_model_name TEXT,
    timestamp TEXT,
    is_active TEXT DEFAULT 'Y',
    is_best TEXT DEFAULT 'Y',
    PRIMARY KEY (character, llm_provider, llm_model_name)
)
```

### Setup Instructions

1. **Set up the backend:**
   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Initialize the database with sample data
   python init_db.py
   
   # Start the FastAPI server
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Set up the frontend:**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Start the development server
   npm run serve
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:8080
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000
   - API documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

### Key Features and Usage

1. **Search for characters:**
   - Use the search form at the top to filter characters by various criteria
   - Click "Search" to apply filters or "Reset" to clear all filters

2. **View character details:**
   - Click on any character in the table to view its details in the form below

3. **Update a character:**
   - Select a character from the table
   - Modify its details in the form
   - Click "Save" to update the character in the database

4. **Create a new character:**
   - Click the "New" button
   - Fill in the character details in the form
   - Click "Save" to add the character to the database

5. **Deactivate a character:**
   - Select a character from the table
   - Click "Delete" to mark it as inactive (soft delete)

The application includes responsive design and form validation to ensure data integrity. The search functionality allows filtering by character, meaning, provider, and active status, making it easy to find specific characters.
